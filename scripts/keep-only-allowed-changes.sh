# Reverts every working-tree change that is neither part of the bump itself (the paths
# recorded in <snapshot-file>) nor matched by <allow-regex>. Runs right after the Claude
# repair step, so the deterministic rebuild judges only edits the prompt permitted - a
# "fix" that touched the csproj version, the wrapper or a workflow is discarded here, not
# shipped.
#
# Usage: scripts/keep-only-allowed-changes.sh <snapshot-file> <allow-regex>
#   snapshot-file: `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | cut -c4-` taken before
#                  the agent ran (one path per line).
#   allow-regex:   bash extended regex matched against the repo-relative path.
